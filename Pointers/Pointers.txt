For people still confused on Pointers, I thought of a little analogy:

Say your friend wants to know where you live. Think of your hometown as memory, with lots of houses being stored (variables), and addresses to locate them (pointers). You wouldn't show your friend, say, a picture of your house and expect them to find it quickly. Therefore, you would give your friend your house's address (a pointer), so they can locate it easily.

Now, let's put it to proper terms.

C wants to know what the variable you're referring to is. You have storage, with lots of variables being stored, and addresses to locate them. You can't give C your variable name and expect C to find it amongst all of your other variables, so you refer to its address is a pointer so C can easily locate it.

Hope this helped :)
